The Visualization contains a stacked/singular area graph to display the overall trend of EDM genres over the course of the past 3 years (2013 January ~ 2015 December).
The graph was inspired by this: http://research.google.com/bigpicture/music/# graph which allows users to explore different genres of music over time.
The data was scraped through the past 3 years' data from the beatport top 100 songs charts.
The impact a genre had on the musical trends was determined by how many songs were in the top-100 charts at a certain point in time. The y-range exceeds 100 at times because sometimes certain songs are considered as multiple genres, and sometimes charts contain songs that are considered as multiple genres (106 in a month may mean that out of 100 songs, 6 of them can be considered as multiple genres ex: House, Electro House).

When a certain area portion of the graph or a genre from the menu is selected, the graph will filter the data and display the chosen data only, allowing the users to explore the change of the genre's impact over time.
The users can use the graph with whole data to answer some questions such as: what were some of the more popular genres in certain time era; and what are the genres that are more impactful compared to others?
The users can use the filtered graph to examine more detailed questions such as: which genres consistently appear on the chart; which genres were fads and diminished over time; and which genres are loved by small audiences?
Using the graph, we can see that dubstep was a fad in 2013 because it reaches the top charts, but eventually fade away to never show up again. On the other hand, tech house is already impactful in 2013, but grows even more over time, whlie progressive house is the opposite 
However, we also see genres like drum and bass, where it consistently appears on the chart with 1~2 songs very often, meaning they probably have a smaller audience that consistently listen to the said genre.

The breadcrumb layout of the menu allows the users to view all of the genres at once, and to highlight the data that is selected, visual encoding of opacity and the physical appearance of the genre's name on the top of the chart is used. Tooltips also appear when mouse is hovering over a portion of graph.
Overall, the graph uses multiple cues (position, color, opacity, and area) to allow the users to compare data. This is excellent because the users have a choice of different visual encodings to interpret the data and is given more freedom.
When singular area graphs are shown through filtering, the users can accurately determine the impact, growth, and diminishing of each genre comparing position against a scale.
The slopes allow the users to use direction to help encode the rise and fall of popularity of each genre. The area gives the users an extra cue to compare vertical length of the genre's impact in each time point.
